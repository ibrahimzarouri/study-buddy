# StudyBuddy — Technical Documentation

StudyBuddy is an AI learning partner developed as a Master's project at the Westphalian University of Applied Sciences (Institute for Internet Security). It lets students upload their own lecture materials and verifies their understanding through an iterative Socratic dialogue: the agent asks comprehension questions grounded strictly in the uploaded material, evaluates the student's explanations, and keeps asking targeted follow-up questions until every key concept of a topic has been explained.

## 2. Processing Pipeline

1. **Upload & parsing** — the student uploads a PDF, DOCX, or TXT file. `document_loader.load_document()` extracts plain text (via `pypdf` for PDFs, `python-docx` for Word documents). Documents yielding fewer than 50 characters are rejected as unparseable.

2. **Indexing (RAG)** — `RAGIndex` splits the text into chunks of 600 characters with 80 characters of overlap, embeds them with the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence-transformer model (normalized embeddings), and stores them in a FAISS `IndexFlatIP` index (inner product ≙ cosine similarity).

3. **Topic extraction** — because long documents exceed the prompt budget, `_sample_text()` takes evenly spaced samples from the beginning, middle, and end of the document (~4,800 characters total). The LLM returns 3–8 topic names as a JSON array.

4. **Concept extraction** — when the student selects a topic, the agent retrieves the most relevant chunks for that topic and asks the LLM for the **3–5 key concepts** a student must explain to prove full understanding. These become the mastery checklist.

5. **Question loop** — the agent picks the first uncovered concept, retrieves context for it, and generates one focused comprehension question (single-focus, under 25 words, never repeating previously asked questions).

6. **Evaluation** — the student's answer is evaluated against retrieved context only. The LLM returns structured JSON: a score (`correct` / `partial` / `incorrect`), encouraging feedback, an optional follow-up question, and the list of key concepts the answer demonstrably covered.

7. **Mastery tracking** — covered concepts are checked off. Weak answers trigger targeted follow-ups (max. 2 per question, then the concept is retried from a fresh angle). The topic is **mastered** only when every key concept has been covered — implementing the assignment requirement of an iterative dialogue *"until a topic has been fully explained"*.

## 3. Application State Machine (`app.py`)

```
 upload ──► topic_select ──► questioning ◄──► feedback
                 ▲                │               │
                 │                ▼               │
                 └───────────  mastered  ◄────────┘
```

| State | Meaning | Transitions |
|---|---|---|
| `upload` | No document loaded yet | → `topic_select` after successful upload |
| `topic_select` | Topics listed in sidebar | → `questioning` when a topic is chosen |
| `questioning` | A question is active; chat input shown | → stays on follow-up, → `feedback` or `mastered` after evaluation |
| `feedback` | Answer evaluated; action buttons shown | → `questioning` (next question), `topic_select` (change), or restart |
| `mastered` | All key concepts covered 🎉 | → `topic_select` or restart topic |

Conversation history, the agent instance, and all state live in `st.session_state`.

---

## 4. The Agent (`agent/study_agent.py`)

`StudyBuddyAgent` holds the LLM client and the per-topic learning state:

| Attribute | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `concepts: dict[str, bool]` | Mastery checklist — concept name → covered? |
| `current_concept` | The concept the active question targets |
| `asked_questions: list[str]` | History passed to the LLM to prevent repeated questions |
| `follow_up_count` / `max_follow_ups` | Limits follow-ups per question (2) before retrying from a new angle |

Key methods:

- `extract_topics()` — document-wide topic list (JSON, with plain-text fallback parsing)
- `start_topic(topic)` — resets state, extracts key concepts, asks the first question
- `evaluate_answer(answer)` — retrieves context, gets structured evaluation, updates concept coverage; suppresses follow-ups once the topic is complete or the limit is reached
- `next_question()` — targets the next uncovered concept
- `progress` / `topic_complete` — used by the UI for the progress bar and mastery detection

**Robust LLM output handling:** `_parse_json()` tolerates markdown code fences, `<think>…</think>` reasoning blocks, and JSON embedded in surrounding prose. If parsing fails entirely, the agent falls back to a neutral "partial" evaluation, so a malformed LLM response never crashes a session.

---

## 5. Prompt Design (`agent/prompts.py`)

All four prompts share two design rules:

1. **Material-only grounding** — every prompt containing retrieved context carries a strict instruction to use *only* that context and never general knowledge. This keeps questions and evaluations faithful to what the lecturer actually taught.
2. **Language matching** — topics, concepts, questions, and feedback are generated in the language of the uploaded material (German slides produce German questions).

| Prompt | Role | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `TOPIC_EXTRACTION_PROMPT` | Find main topics in the sampled document | JSON array of topic names |
| `CONCEPT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT` | Derive the mastery checklist per topic | JSON array of 3–5 concepts |
| `QUESTION_GENERATION_PROMPT` | One focused question (single aspect, < 25 words) about a target concept, avoiding repeats | Plain question text |
| `EVALUATION_PROMPT` | Grade an answer against the context and checklist | JSON: `score`, `feedback`, `follow_up`, `missing`, `covered_concepts` |

### Evaluation JSON schema

```json
{
  "score": "correct | partial | incorrect",
  "feedback": "1-2 encouraging, specific sentences",
  "follow_up": "single-focus question addressing the biggest gap, or null",
  "missing": "the key concept the student missed, or null",
  "covered_concepts": ["names copied exactly from the checklist"]
}
```

## 6. Configuration

The app is configured entirely via `.env` (see `.env.example`) and works with any OpenAI-compatible API:

| Variable | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `API_KEY` | API key for the LLM endpoint | — |
| `BASE_URL` | OpenAI-compatible base URL | `https://chat.kiconnect.nrw/api/v1` |
| `MODEL` | Model identifier at that endpoint | `OpenAI-GPT-5-Mini` |

> Note: the currently used model rejects non-default `temperature` values, so the agent deliberately sends none.

---

## 7. Testing

22 unit tests (`pytest`) cover the deterministic, LLM-independent logic:

- **JSON parsing** — plain JSON, markdown fences, `<think>` blocks, JSON embedded in prose, invalid input
- **Text sampling** — short documents returned whole; long documents sampled from start/middle/end within budget
- **Concept matching** — exact, case-/whitespace-insensitive, unknown names ignored
- **Chunking** — size limits, overlap correctness, blank-line collapsing, empty input
- **Document loading** — TXT decoding, rejection of unsupported file types

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

LLM-dependent behavior (question quality, evaluation accuracy) is validated manually through exploratory testing with real lecture materials.

---

## 8. Design Decisions

- **No agent framework (LangChain etc.)** — the pipeline is a small, fixed sequence of LLM calls plus one vector index. Direct use of the OpenAI client and FAISS keeps the code transparent, debuggable, and dependency-light.
- **Material as ground truth** — grounding everything in the uploaded document is what makes the tool useful for exam preparation (it tests *the course*, not the internet). The trade-off is deliberate: see limitations.
- **Concept checklist as mastery criterion** — an explicit, inspectable definition of "topic fully explained", visible to the student as a progress bar and checklist, rather than an opaque LLM judgment.
- **Follow-up limit with retry-from-new-angle** — prevents frustrating dead-end loops on a single question while still refusing to skip unmastered concepts.

## 9. Known Limitations

- **Errors in the material are defended.** The evaluator treats the lecture material as ground truth by design; if a slide contains a typo (e.g., a wrong constant), StudyBuddy will initially challenge a factually correct student answer. In practice the dialogue lets students reconcile such conflicts, but the behavior should be understood.
- **No session persistence.** A browser refresh discards the session (Streamlit `session_state` is per-connection). Progress is not saved between visits.
- **One document at a time.** Uploading a new file replaces the previous index; topics cannot span multiple documents yet.
- **Re-uploading a file with the same name** but changed content is not detected (only the filename is compared).
- **PDF text extraction quality** depends on the source document; scanned (image-only) PDFs yield no text since no OCR is performed.

## 10. Future Work

- Session persistence and per-student progress history
- End-of-session learning summary ("mastered X, review Y") and export
- Multi-document support (whole-course index)
- CI pipeline running the test suite on every push
- Optional OCR for scanned PDFs
